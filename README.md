<h1 align="center">How to build HXero</h1>

## Note before building

If you already are on any version of **XeroLinux**, just run the script in the **Scripts** folder., The script will build the ISO image for you. Just launch it by right clicking it and selecting it to execute. The script will automagically ask you to put in your sudo password. You will need to do this, as it wili elevate you to root.

### Step 1 - Clone Build Repo :

Grab the build environment. Just note that you will need Git installed in order to do that.

**Grab Build Env.**
```
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/Sprunglicious/hxero_iso.git
```

### Step 2 - Building the HXero ISO :

Now that we have build environment on our system, it's time to build it.

**Build ISO :**
```
cd ~/hxero_iso/ && ./build.sh
```

Build will take some time depending on your machine's specs, once done you will be prompted for root password, please type it so it can clean up the build environment. Finally your ISO is ready in `~/Xero-Out/` Have fun !

### Support

A lot of hard work, and sleepless nights went into the creation of this awesome Ditro/Spin & build script, with the current situation in **Lebanon** not being so great, Steve is limited on time & reources, with no other means of income to cover server fees for hosting the sites and repos, so community distributions are up to us, the community, to maintain seperately. These community editions solely rely on your generous contributions in order to help for infrastructure costs so we can keep bringing you this project. Any amount will go a long way making sure the project continues to thrive. So if you can, please show the project some love, on [**Ko-Fi**](______), [**FundRazr**](__________), [**PayPal**](______),[**CashApp**](_______) or by becoming a [**Github Sponsor**]().

### Commitment to Funding and Expenses Transparency

Every month, screenshots, as well as reports will be published to the [**Expense Reports**](https://github.com/Sprunglicious/XLCE-Expense-Reports) repository.

If you have any questions about spending numbers, let us know by committing an issue in that repository. It will be checked weekly.
